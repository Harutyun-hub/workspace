You are absolutely right. I apologize. I fell into the trap of building a "Standard SaaS Dashboard" (dropdowns, date pickers) instead of the "Cognitive Warfare" System we designed.

Let's reset.

The Goal: A War Room, not a report. The Research Said: Don't ask the user to hunt for answers with filters. Push the answer to them. . The Problem with V1: It's ambiguous. You see a "Red Bar" and have to ask "Is that an Ad? A Post? Is it Google or Facebook?" Filters are a band-aid. The visualization itself should answer that.

Here is the Corrected Architecture to fix the "Battlefield" without resorting to boring dropdowns.

The New Concept: "The Stacked Frontline"
Instead of hiding data behind a "Source Selector," we will visualize the Composition of the Attack directly on the chart.

1. The Chart Logic: "Total Firepower" (Stacked Streamgraph) We will keep the "Us vs. Them" reflection (Blue Up, Red Down), but we will stack the bars to show exactly what the activity is.

The Enemy (Red Side - Downwards):

Layer 1 (The Heavy Artillery): Paid Ads (Facebook + Google).

Color: Neon Red (#EF4444). Solid, bright.

Meaning: "They are spending money here."

Layer 2 (The Infantry): Organic Posts (Instagram).

Color: Faded Red / Dark Maroon (rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3)).

Meaning: "They are just posting content."

The Defense (Blue Side - Upwards):

Layer 1: Our Ads (Neon Blue).

Layer 2: Our Posts (Faded Blue).

The Result: You look at the chart and instantly see: "Wow, that huge Red spike isn't just noise; it's 90% Paid Ads (Neon Red). They are launching a blitz." No dropdowns needed.

2. The "Intel Feed" (Context) You rightly asked: "What actual data is represented?" We will add a Side Panel called "Live Intel Feed" next to the chart.

Interaction: When you hover over a bar on the chart (e.g., Dec 25th), the Side Panel updates to show the actual top 3 creatives from that day.

Why: This connects the "Abstract Number" (Bars) to the "Real Threat" (Images).

Master Prompt: Task 3 - The Stacked Frontline (Corrected)
Context: We are rebuilding the "Battlefield" Chart in war_room.html. Correction: The previous chart was too vague. We are scrapping the single-color bars. We need a Stacked Bar Chart that distinguishes between Paid Aggression (Ads) and Organic Noise (Posts) instantly.

1. The Visualization: "Stacked Reflection Chart" Update the Chart.js configuration to have 4 Datasets (2 for Us, 2 for Them).

Dataset 1: Enemy Paid Ads (Facebook + Google)

Data: Negative Counts.

Style: backgroundColor: '#EF4444' (Bright Neon Red).

Stack: 'Them'

Dataset 2: Enemy Organic (Instagram)

Data: Negative Counts.

Style: backgroundColor: 'rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3)' (Faded/Ghost Red).

Stack: 'Them'

Dataset 3: Friendly Paid Ads

Data: Positive Counts.

Style: backgroundColor: '#3B82F6' (Bright Neon Blue).

Stack: 'Us'

Dataset 4: Friendly Organic

Data: Positive Counts.

Style: backgroundColor: 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3)' (Faded Blue).

Stack: 'Us'

2. The Data Logic (loadBattlefieldData) Refactor the data fetching to split the counts:

Query: Fetch facebook_ads, google_ads, and instagram_posts for the selected companies.

Loop: For each day:

Enemy Paid = Sum of Enemy FB Ads + Enemy Google Ads.

Enemy Organic = Sum of Enemy Insta Posts.

(Repeat for Friendly).

3. The Interaction: "Intel Feed" (Context)

Layout: Create a 2-column layout for the Battlefield section.

Left (70%): The Chart.

Right (30%): A new panel titled "INTEL FEED".

Logic:

On hover of a chart bar, find the specific posts/ads from that day.

Render them as small "cards" in the Intel Feed panel.

Content: Show the Image Thumbnail and Headline (or truncated text).

Default: If no hover, show the most recent 3 items from the "Enemy Paid" category.

4. Design Polish

Legend: Custom HTML Legend above the chart:

[■ Bright Red] PAID OFFENSIVE

[■ Faded Red] ORGANIC NOISE

Y-Axis: Remove the numbers. Keep the bright white "Frontline" at 0.

Action: Refactor the Battlefield to use Stacked Bars (Paid vs Organic) and add the "Intel Feed" sidebar to visualize the actual content behind the numbers.
