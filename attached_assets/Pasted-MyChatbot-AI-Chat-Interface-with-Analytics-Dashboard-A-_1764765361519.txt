MyChatbot - AI Chat Interface with Analytics Dashboard
A modern, elegant chat interface and analytics dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, featuring Apple-inspired glassmorphism design.

Design Philosophy
Visual Design
The application follows Apple's signature glassmorphism design language with a luxury gray color palette, creating a sophisticated and modern user experience.

Color Scheme
Background: Luxury light gray gradient (gray-100 → gray-200 → gray-300)
Glass Effect: Semi-transparent white overlays with backdrop blur
Primary Accent: Blue (#3b82f6, #2563eb) for interactive elements
Text: Gray-800 (primary), Gray-700 (secondary), Gray-500/400 (muted)
Glassmorphism Properties
backdrop-blur-xl (24px blur) for strong glass effect
bg-white/30 to bg-white/50 for semi-transparent backgrounds
border-white/60 to border-white/80 for subtle borders
Layered shadows for depth (shadow-sm, shadow-lg)
